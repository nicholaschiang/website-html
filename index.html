        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          I am a software engineer who specializes in web development—currently
          at a stealth startup.
        </p>
        <p>
          From 2018–2019, I helped
          <a href="https://luke.hsiao.dev">Luke Hsiao</a> and
          <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/wusen">Sen Wu</a> with

          at <a href="https://sing.stanford.edu">Stanford University</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Starting in 2020, I worked on
          <a href="https://tutorbook.org">Tutorbook</a> to coordinate
          <a href="https://pausd.org">PAUSD</a>’s and
          <a href="https://schoolsimplified.org">School Simplified</a>’s peer
          tutoring programs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Last year, I developed
          <a href="https://readhammock.com">a newsletter reader</a> with two
          product people: <a href="https://martinsrna.com">Martin Srna</a> and

        </p>
        <p>
          I worked at

          <h3>The Fashion Index</h3>
          <p>
            The ultimate goal of this project is to create an interface that I
            can use to objectively rank and queue up high fashion purchases. I
            want an organized browser of the world of fashion.
          </p>
          <h4>Ex: Top-down view of EVERYTHING about a product.</h4>
          <p>
            It would be super cool IMO to open a product page and, in addition
            to seeing sizing, images, modeling, prices (from the various
            retailers that stock said item), one could also see the designer who
            made it (and easily see what else that designer has made and what
            other companies that designer has worked for), the company that owns
            the product's brand (and recent financial news regarding said
            corporation), etc.
          </p>
          <h4>Ex: Product comparisons like Apple.</h4>
          <p>
            It could also be cool to be able to match up similar products from
            different brands (as most brands' ready-to-wear collections will
            typically follow similar trends and thus contain similar pieces) in
            a side-by-side feature comparison view (similar to how you can
            compare different Apple products before making a decision on which
            one to buy): e.g. you could open up a Dior sweater and a GUCCI
            sweater side-by-side and make your purchase decision not only based
            on price or material sourcing or factory location or designer but
            also by the brand's reputation index (a.k.a. if resale value might
            increase) or a corporations climate change policies (or the lack
            thereof).
          </p>
          <h3>Implementation</h3>
          <p>
            To implement features like that, I'll need a really good database
            schema (see
            <a href="https://github.com/nicholaschiang/site/pull/1">#1</a>). And
            then all that needs to be done is:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              figuring out where and how to scrape all of this data (ideally I
              want all past collections as well);
            </li>
            <li>
              building a basic page-based application with all of this data
              (perhaps using ISG from Next.js or similar).
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Pages</h3>
          <p>
            The initial MVP will only contain a few pages (see
            <a href="https://github.com/nicholaschiang/site/pull/4">#4</a>):
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              a basic <code>/products</code> page that lets users see a massive
              list of all the products in our database (and filter them using
              Linear style filters... filter sets can be saved as "views");
            </li>
            <li>
              a <code>/products/{id}</code> page that lets users see all the
              details of a particular product (prices, sizes, collections,
              variants, brands, companies, countries, runway shows, etc);
            </li>
            <li>
              a <code>/views</code> page that shows a list of the user's views
              that they've saved from <code>/products</code> filters (these are
              essentially just sets of filters);
            </li>
            <li>
              a <code>/views/{id}</code> page that is the same as the
              <code>/products</code> page but clicking the "Save" button updates
              the view instead of creating a new view (and trying to navigate
              away from the page after changing filters and not saving will
              surface a warning asking the user if they'd like to save their
              changes).
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The initial
            <a
              href="https://www.figma.com/file/ywAIsTAX7LPEKWpd0IpZtg/DRIP?node-id=1%3A3&t=G0xjG4AfLi1dUXMn-1"
              >Figma mockup</a
            >
            of the <code>/products</code> page (inspired by Linear's issues
            filtering features):
          </p>

        <p>
          This project is a parody of the original game Simon by Milton-Bradley.
          It is a very basic repetitive memory game where one follows the
          demonstrated color sequence until one makes a mistake. The longer the
          sequence one can repeat, the greater one's score becomes.
        </p>
        <p>
          While building this example application, I felt quite limited by the
          no-CSS and no-JS constraint; more so by the no-CSS constraint, however
          (e.g. with SSR, you can get away with some pretty complex patterns all
          without a line of JS running client-side).
